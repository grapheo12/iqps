Periodically, after every semester, the admin needs scrape the new papers posted in the library website.

This can be done using ``scripts/pdfFinder.py`` script in the repo.

To automate the process in production, ``cron jobs`` can be scheduled.
The JSON file generated by this process should be uploaded via the bulk upload option as said in the Usage section.

The admin also needs to generate keywords metadata for the files.
To ease its automation ``scripts/keywordProcessor.py`` is given.

THIS SCRIPT MUST BE RUN LOCALLY.

Running this in the server creates excess overload unless the server has GPUs.
